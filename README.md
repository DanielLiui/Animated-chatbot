# Toolkit
1. Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS
2. Backend: Flask
3. APIs: OpenAI, Google Cloud's text-to-speech


# Folders & files
- Some folders & files like Lib, Scripts, & pyvenv.cfg are needed for the virtual environment


# How to run the app in an IDE
Setting up the API keys takes quite a few steps, so I don't recommend running the app locally
